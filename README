**BACKGROUND**
**************
vecscreen is the established NCBI program to identify matches between
(query) sequences and (subject) vectors in UniVec. These matches may
represent (true) vector contamination, but experience has shown that there
can be many false positives.  A primary reason for false positives is
that the query and the matching subject segment come from the same
genus or closely related genera. Therefore, knowing the genus of the
query sequence is helpful to interpret the ouput.  For what follows
below, it is relevant that vecscreen distinguishes matches by two
characteristics:

1) Location: Internal or Terminal 
A match is Terminal if and only if it includes a nucleotide within 25
positions of either end of the query

2) Strength: Strong, Moderate, or Weak
A match is Strong if either: it is terminal with a raw score of at
least 24 or it is internal with a raw score of at least 30.

A match is Moderate if if either: it is terminal with a raw score in
the interval [19,23] or internal with a raw score in the interval
[25,29]. 

A match is Weak if it is terminal with a raw score in the interval
[16,18] or internal with a raw score in the interval [23,24].

vecscreen also reports internal alignments with raw scores in the range [16,
22] when there is also a reportable match for the same (query, vector)
pair. The score range [16,22] is below the Weak range match for
internal matches. In the script from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl, 
these below-Weak Internal matches are assigned the level None.

In this document 'vecscreen' refers to the command-line version, not the
Web page version.

**RELEVANT FILES**
******************
Several executable files are required for from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl
to work. Two of these executables were developed by others and must be
downloaded and installed separately. The full list of files is:

1. from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl 
   This is the main script that does all the work by calling 
   the other executables listed below.

   /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dnaorg/2015.09/vector_screening/test9b/from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl

2. parse_vecscreen.pl
   Auxiliary script called by from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl that parses
   the vecscreen output.
   
   /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dnaorg/2015.09/vector_screening/test9b/parse_vecscreen.pl

3. combine_summaries.pl
   Auxiliary script called by from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl that 
   combines two different output formats of parse_vecscreen.pl

   /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dnaorg/2015.09/vector_screening/test9b/combine_summaries.pl

4. add_taxonomy.pl
   Auxiliary script called by from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl that 
   adds taxonomy information to the output of parse_vecscreen.pl.

   /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dnaorg/2015.09/vector_screening/test9b/add_taxonomy.pl

5. assign_levels_to_taxonomy.pl
   Independent script that is used to create a taxonomy file from the
   NCBI taxonomy that is required input to
   from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl.

   /panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dnaorg/2015.09/vector_screening/test9a/assign_levels_to_taxonomy.pl

*********************
**USAGE AND OPTIONS**
*********************
Here is an example command that will run from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl
on the fasta file myseqs.fa using the taxonomy file
taxonomy_tree_wlevels.txt.

> from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl --input_fasta myseqs.fa --input_taxa taxonomy_tree_wlevels.txt

The sequence file (myseqs.fa) can be any sequence file in FASTA format.

The taxonomy file (taxonomy_tree_wlevels.txt) is a file in a special
format that includes taxonomy information for vecscreen vectors. This
can either be created by the user from the NCBI taxonomy file, or the
user can use the provided file:

/panfs/pan1.be-md.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dnaorg/2015.09/vector_screening/test9b/taxonomy_tree_wlevels.txt

which was created in December 2016. If you are using this in the first
few months of 2017, the provided file above should be fine. After
that, you should create a new up-to-date file. Instructions for doing
that are provided below in the section CREATING THE TAXONOMY FILE.

The options that can be provided to from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl are:
  --input_fasta <s> : REQUIRED file name <s> with sequences in fasta format 
  --input_taxa <s>  : REQUIRED file name <s> mapping vecscreen matches to taxa
  --output_root <s> : REQUIRED root for output files names
  --verbose         : be verbose in output
  --combine_output  : combine internal and terminal matches
  --keep	    : keep temporary vecscreen output file


The  --input_fasta <s> and --input_taxa <s> and --output_root <s>
options are required when running from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl, while
--verbose and --combine_output and --keep are optional.
By default --verbose and --combine_ouput and --keep are all turned off.

The --combine_output option determines whether one or two files of
output are produced.  Currently the names of the output files are
partly fixed at: 
<output_root>.output_combined_wtaxonomy.txt (if --combine_output is applied) 
<output_root>.output_internal_wtaxonomy.txt (if --combine_output is not applied) 
<output_root>.output_terminal_wtaxonomy.txt (if --combine_output is not applied)

The option --verbose determines how many columns of output are
produced, as described in the OUTPUT section below. It does not
cause more diagnostic output to be printed during the execution
of the script.

The option --keep determines whether the output file from
running vecscreen within the script is kept (--keep on) or
deleted (--keep off, default).

***********
**METHODS**
***********

Given the input taxonomy file and an input sequence file in FASTA
format, from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl will
do the following:

1) Run vecscreen on the input FASTA-formatted sequence file to
   identify high-scoring matches to known vector sequences in UniVec
   in the input sequence file.

2) Parse the vecscreen output into two tab-delimited files for
   internal and terminal matches by calling parse_vecscreen.pl.

3) Optionally combine the two summary files into one by calling
   combine_summaries.pl.

4) Add taxonomy information to the vescreen output by calling srcchk
   and add_taxonomy.pl.


**********
**OUTPUT**
**********
from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl will create one line of tabular output
per vecscreen hit in the input sequence file. There are two possible
output formats. For both formats, columns are separated by tabs.

--------------------------------
Default output format: 5 columns
--------------------------------
By default (if --verbose is not used) then the format of those lines
will be the following five columns:

Column 1: Accession of query
Column 2: Genus of query if known, or 1 otherwise
Column 3: Matching vector, starting with uv|
Column 4: One end of the alignment in the vector
Column 5: The other end of the alignment in the vector

This 5 column format was agreed on for internal NCBI usage in JIRA
ticket SM-187.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Verbose output format (enabled with --verbose option: 11 columns
----------------------------------------------------------------
If --verbose is used, then each line of output will include the
following 11 columns:

Column 1: Accession of query
Column 2: Genus of query if known, or 1 otherwise
Column 3: Species of query if known, or 1 otherwise
Column 4: Lower end of the alignment in the vector
Column 5: Upper end of the alignment in the vector
Column 6: Matching vector, starting with uv|
Column 7: One end of the alignment in the vector
Column 8: The other end of the alignment in the vector
Column 9: The strength of this vecscreen match 
Column 10: The strength of the strongest vecscreen match for this query
Column 11: Whether there is any dangling part (called "Suspect" by vecscreen) at either end of the query

A dangling part is an unmatched segment of <= 25 nucleotides.  

This alternative 11-column format has been shown to be useful for some
purposes, such as correcting vector-contaminated sequences in GenBank.


******************************
**CREATING THE TAXONOMY FILE**
******************************
This section describes how to create the taxonomy input file (passed
in to from_vecscreen_to_summary.pl with the --input_taxa <s> option)
using the NCBI taxonomy file.

NCBI's taxonomy is available from directory
ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/.

We start from any of the files: 
taxdmp.tar.Z 
taxdump.tar.gz 
taxdmp.zip
from which one can extract the file nodes.dmp.

Then execute the following commands:

> cut -f1,3,5 nodes.dmp > taxonomy_tree.txt
> assign_levels_to_taxonomy.pl --input_taxa taxonomy_tree.txt --outfile taxonomy_tree_wlevels.txt

taxonomy_tree.txt will have three columns:
Column 1: taxid as an an integer
Column 2: parent taxid as an an integer
Column 3: rank (e.g., phylum) as a word

Running assign_levels_to_taxonomy.pl will add a fourth column which is
the level in the taxonomy tree, where the root has level 1 and each
child taxid has a level one greter than the level of its parent taxid.
